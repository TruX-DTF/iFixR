Characters that are represented as a 2 characters internaly by java are incorrectly converted by the function. The following test displays the problem quite nicely:
import org.apache.commons.lang.*;
public class J2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // this is the utf8 representation of the character:
        // COUNTING ROD UNIT DIGIT THREE
        // in unicode
        // codepoint: U+1D362
        byte[] data = new byte[] 
{ (byte)0xF0, (byte)0x9D, (byte)0x8D, (byte)0xA2 }
;
        //output is: &#55348;&#57186;
        // should be: &#119650;
        System.out.println("'" + StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml(new String(data, "UTF8")) + "'");
    }
}
Should be very quick to fix, feel free to drop me an email if you want a patch.
