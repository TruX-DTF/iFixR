In commons-lang 2.6 line 250 :

ch = chars[random.nextInt(gap) + start];

This line of code takes a random int to fetch a char in the chars array regardless of its size.
(Besides start is useless here)
Fixed version would be :

//ch = chars[random.nextInt(gap)%chars.length];

When user pass 0 as end or when the array is not null but empty this line ends up with an exception
