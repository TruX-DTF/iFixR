Method createNumber from NumberUtils is trying to parse a string with a floating point number always first as a Float, that will cause that if we send a string with a number that will need a Double or even a BigDecimal the number will be truncate to accommodate into the Float without an exception to be thrown, so in fact we will no be returning ever neither a Double nor a BigDecimal.
