Hi,
Javadocs of Locale.toString() states that "If the language is missing, the string will begin with an underbar.". This is not handled in the LocaleUtils.toLocale method if it is meant to be the inversion method of Locale.toString().
The fix for the ticket 328 does not handle well the case "fr__P", which I found out during fixing the first bug.
I am attaching the patch for both problems.
