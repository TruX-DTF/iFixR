In my opinion, it is a bug that suspend() acts as split(), if followed by stop(); see below:
        StopWatch sw = new StopWatch();
        sw.start();
        Thread.sleep(1000);
        sw.suspend();
        // Time 1 (ok)
        System.out.println(sw.getTime());
        Thread.sleep(2000);
        // Time 1 (again, ok)
        System.out.println(sw.getTime());
        sw.resume();
        Thread.sleep(3000);
        sw.suspend();
        // Time 2 (ok)
        System.out.println(sw.getTime());
        Thread.sleep(4000);
        // Time 2 (again, ok)
        System.out.println(sw.getTime());
        Thread.sleep(5000);
        sw.stop();
        // Time 2 (should be, but is Time 3 => NOT ok)
        System.out.println(sw.getTime());
suspend/resume is like a pause, where time counter doesn't continue. So a following stop()-call shouldn't increase the time counter, should it?
