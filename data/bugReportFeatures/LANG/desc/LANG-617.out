Supplementary characters in UTF-16 are those whose code points are above 0xffff, that is, require more than 1 Java char to be encoded, as explained here: http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Intl/Supplementary/
Currently, StringEscapeUtils.escapeXML() isn't aware of this coding scheme and treats each char as one character, which is not always right.
A possible solution in class Entities would be:
    public void escape(Writer writer, String str) throws IOException {
        int len = str.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            int code = str.codePointAt;
            String entityName = this.entityName(code);
            if (entityName != null) 
{
                writer.write('&');
                writer.write(entityName);
                writer.write(';');
            }
 else if (code > 0x7F) 
{
                    writer.write("&#");
                    writer.write(code);
                    writer.write(';');
            }
 else 
{
                    writer.write((char) code);
            }

            if (code > 0xffff) 
{
                    i++;
            }
        }
    }
Besides fixing escapeXML(), this will also affect HTML escaping functions. I guess that's a good thing, but please remember I have only tested escapeXML().
