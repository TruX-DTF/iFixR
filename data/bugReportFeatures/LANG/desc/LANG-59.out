Try to truncate 2004-10-31 01:00:00 MDT by hour and you'll actually get 2004-10-
31 01:00:00 MST, which is one hour after the input hour.
    // truncate 2004-10-31 01:00:00 MDT
    Date oct31_01MDT = new Date(1099206000000L);    
    Date result = DateUtils.truncate(oct31_01MDT, Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY);
    assertEquals(oct31_01MDT, result);
