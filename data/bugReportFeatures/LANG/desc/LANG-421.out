Commons Lang 2.4 StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava(String) now escapes '/' characters, which is not a valid "escapable" character in Java strings.  I haven't tried the other Java escape/unescape methods to see if they have a similar problem, or that only Java "escapable" characters are escaped by escapeJava(String).
This bug may have appeared as an unintended side-effect of the fix for LANG-363.
Also the javadoc for escapeJava is now a little off, in that '/' should now be included in the sentence describing the differences between Java and Javascript strings, with respect to escaping rules.
The following is a JUnit3 test demonstrating the bug.
import junit.framework.TestCase;
import org.apache.commons.lang.StringEscapeUtils;
public class StringEscapeUtilsTest extends TestCase {
    public void testEscapeJavaWithSlash() 
{
        final String input = "String with a slash (/) in it";
        
        final String expected = input;
        final String actual   = StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava( input );

        /**
         * In 2.4 StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava(String) escapes '/' characters,
         * which are not a valid character to escape in a Java string.  
         */
        assertEquals( expected, actual );
    }
}
