In WordUtils.abbreviate, upper is adjusted to the length of the string, then to lower.
But lower is never adjusted to the length of the string, so if lower is greater than str.lengt(), upper will be too...
Then, str.substring(0, upper) throw a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
The fix is to adjust lower to the length of the string
