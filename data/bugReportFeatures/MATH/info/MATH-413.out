However there remains a \"semantic\" problem: One cannot be sure that the list of points means the same thing for the caller of \"converged\" and within the implementation of the \"ConvergenceChecker\" that was independently set.\nIt is not clear whether it is wise to aggregate the counter of gradient evaluations to the function evaluation counter. In \"LevenbergMarquartdOptimizer\" for example, it would be unfair to do so. Currently I had to remove all tests referring to gradient and Jacobian evaluations.\nIn \"AbstractLeastSquaresOptimizer\" and \"LevenbergMarquardtOptimizer\", occurences of \"OptimizationException\" were replaced by the unchecked \"ConvergenceException\" but in some cases it might not be the most appropriate one.\n\"MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer\": in the other classes (\"MultiStartMultivariate...\") similar to this one, the randomization is on the firts-guess value while in this class, it is on the search interval.
