The following unit test:

@Test
public void testBug() {
    final UnivariateRealFunction f = new UnivariateRealFunction() {
            @Override
            public double value(double x) {
                return Math.exp(x) - Math.pow(Math.PI, 3.0);
            }
        };

    UnivariateRealSolver solver = new RegulaFalsiSolver();
    double root = solver.solve(100, f, 1, 10);
}


fails with

illegal state: maximal count (100) exceeded: evaluations


Using "PegasusSolver", the answer is found after 17 evaluations.
