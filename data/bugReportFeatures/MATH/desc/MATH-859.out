The conclusion from [1] was never implemented. We should deprecate these
properties from the RealDistribution interface, but since removal
will have to wait until 4.0, we should agree on a precise
definition and fix the code to match it in the mean time.
The definition that I propose is that isSupportXxxInclusive means
that when the density function is applied to the upper or lower
bound of support returned by getSupportXxxBound, a finite (i.e. not
infinite), not NaN value is returned.
