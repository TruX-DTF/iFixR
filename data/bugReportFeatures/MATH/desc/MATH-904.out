As reported by Jeff Hain:
pow(double,double):
Math.pow(-1.0,5.000000000000001E15) = -1.0
FastMath.pow(-1.0,5.000000000000001E15) = 1.0
===> This is due to considering that power is an even
integer if it is >= 2^52, while you need to test
that it is >= 2^53 for it.
===> replace
"if (y >= TWO_POWER_52 || y <= -TWO_POWER_52)"
with
"if (y >= 2*TWO_POWER_52 || y <= -2*TWO_POWER_52)"
and that solves it.
