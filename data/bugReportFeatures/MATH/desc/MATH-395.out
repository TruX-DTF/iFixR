I apologize for having provided a buggy implementation of Brent's optimization algorithm (class "BrentOptimizer" in package "optimization.univariate").
The unit tests didn't show that there was something wrong, although (from the "changes.xml" file) I discovered that, at the time, Luc had noticed something weird in the implementation's behaviour.
Comparing with an implementation in Python, I could figure out the fixes. I'll modify "BrentOptimizer" and add a test. I also propose to change the name of the unit test class from "BrentMinimizerTest" to "BrentOptimizerTest".
