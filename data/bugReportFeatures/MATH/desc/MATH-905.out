As reported by Jeff Hain:
cosh(double) and sinh(double):
Math.cosh(709.783) = 8.991046692770538E307
FastMath.cosh(709.783) = Infinity
Math.sinh(709.783) = 8.991046692770538E307
FastMath.sinh(709.783) = Infinity
===> This is due to using exp( x )/2 for values of |x|
above 20: the result sometimes should not overflow,
but exp( x ) does, so we end up with some infinity.
===> for values of |x| >= StrictMath.log(Double.MAX_VALUE),
exp will overflow, so you need to use that instead:
for x positive:
double t = exp(x*0.5);
return (0.5*t)*t;
for x negative:
double t = exp(-x*0.5);
return (-0.5*t)*t;
