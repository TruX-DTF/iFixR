I found a bug in the toDouble() method of the Dfp class.
If the Dfp's value is 0 "zero", the toDouble() method returns a  negative infini.
This is because the double value returned has an exposant equal to 0xFFF 
and a significand is equal to 0.
In the IEEE754 this is a -inf.
To be equal to zero, the exposant and the significand must be equal to zero.
A simple test case is :
----------------------------------------------
import org.apache.commons.math.dfp.DfpField;
public class test {
	/**

@param args
	 */
	public static void main(String[] args) 
{
		DfpField field = new DfpField(100);
		System.out.println("toDouble value of getZero() ="+field.getZero().toDouble()+
				"\ntoDouble value of newDfp(0.0) ="+
				field.newDfp(0.0).toDouble());
	}
}

May be the simplest way to fix it is to test the zero equality at the begin of the toDouble() method, to be able to return the correctly signed zero ?
