ChiSquareTestImpl is returning incorrect chi-squared value. An implicit assumption of public double chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed) is that the sum of expected and observed are equal. That is, in the code:
for (int i = 0; i < observed.length; i++) 
{
            dev = ((double) observed[i] - expected[i]);
            sumSq += dev * dev / expected[i];
        }
this calculation is only correct if sum(observed)==sum(expected). When they are not equal then one must rescale the expected value by sum(observed) / sum(expected) so that they are.
Ironically, it is an example in the unit test ChiSquareTestTest that highlights the error:
long[] observed1 = 
{ 500, 623, 72, 70, 31 }
;
        double[] expected1 = 
{ 485, 541, 82, 61, 37 }
;
        assertEquals( "chi-square test statistic", 16.4131070362, testStatistic.chiSquare(expected1, observed1), 1E-10);
        assertEquals("chi-square p-value", 0.002512096, testStatistic.chiSquareTest(expected1, observed1), 1E-9);
16.413 is not correct because the expected values do not make sense, they should be: 521.19403 581.37313  88.11940  65.55224  39.76119 so that the sum of expected equals 1296 which is the sum of observed.
Here is some R code (r-project.org) which proves it:
> o1
[1] 500 623  72  70  31
> e1
[1] 485 541  82  61  37
> chisq.test(o1,p=e1,rescale.p=TRUE)
        Chi-squared test for given probabilities
data:  o1 
X-squared = 9.0233, df = 4, p-value = 0.06052
> chisq.test(o1,p=e1,rescale.p=TRUE)$observed
[1] 500 623  72  70  31
> chisq.test(o1,p=e1,rescale.p=TRUE)$expected
[1] 521.19403 581.37313  88.11940  65.55224  39.76119
