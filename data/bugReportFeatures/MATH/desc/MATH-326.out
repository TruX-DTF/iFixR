the L_infinity norm of a finite dimensional vector is just the max of the absolute value of its entries.
The current implementation in ArrayRealVector has a typo:

    public double getLInfNorm() {
        double max = 0;
        for (double a : data) {
            max += Math.max(max, Math.abs(a));
        }
        return max;
    }


the += should just be an =.
There is sadly a unit test assuring us that this is the correct behavior (effectively a regression-only test, not a test for correctness).
Worse, the implementation in OpenMapRealVector is not even positive semi-definite:

   
    public double getLInfNorm() {
        double max = 0;
        Iterator iter = entries.iterator();
        while (iter.hasNext()) {
            iter.advance();
            max += iter.value();
        }
        return max;
    }


I would suggest that this method be moved up to the AbstractRealVector superclass and implemented using the sparseIterator():

  public double getLInfNorm() {
    double norm = 0;
    Iterator<Entry> it = sparseIterator();
    Entry e;
    while(it.hasNext() && (e = it.next()) != null) {
      norm = Math.max(norm, Math.abs(e.getValue()));
    }
    return norm;
  }


Unit tests with negative valued vectors would be helpful to check for this kind of thing in the future.
