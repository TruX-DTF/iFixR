Problem: commons-math-2.2 SimplexSolver.
A variable with 0 coefficient may be assigned a negative value nevertheless restrictToNonnegative flag in call:
SimplexSolver.optimize(function, constraints, GoalType.MINIMIZE, true);
Function
1 * x + 1 * y + 0
Constraints:
1 * x + 0 * y = 1
Result:
x = 1; y = -1;
Probably variables with 0 coefficients are omitted at some point of computation and because of that the restrictions do not affect their values.
