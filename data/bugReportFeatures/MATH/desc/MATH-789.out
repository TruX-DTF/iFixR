The following three matrices (which are basically permutations of each other) produce different results when sampling a multi-variate Gaussian with the help of CorrelatedRandomVectorGenerator (sample covariances calculated in R, based on 10,000 samples):

I've traced this back to the RectangularCholeskyDecomposition, which does not seem to handle the second matrix very well (decompositions in the same order as the matrices above):

Clearly, the rank of each of these matrices should be 4. The first matrix does not lead to incorrect results, but the second one does. Unfortunately, I don't know enough about the Cholesky decomposition to find the flaw in the implementation, and I could not find documentation for the "rectangular" variant (also not at the links provided in the javadoc).
