The method org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.Variance.evaluate(double[] values, double[] weights, double mean, int begin, int length) does not work properly. Looks loke it ignores the length parameter and grabs the whole dataset.
Similar method in Mean class seems to work.
I did not check other methods taking the part of the array; they may have the same problem.
Workaround: I had to shrink my arrays and use the method without the length.
