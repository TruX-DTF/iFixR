Method 
    BisectionSolver.solve(final UnivariateRealFunction f, double min, double max, double initial)  
invokes 
    BisectionSolver.solve(double min, double max) 
which throws NullPointerException, as member variable
    UnivariateRealSolverImpl.f 
is null.
Instead the method:
    BisectionSolver.solve(final UnivariateRealFunction f, double min, double max)
should be called.
Steps to reproduce:
invoke:
     new BisectionSolver().solve(someUnivariateFunctionImpl, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5);
NullPointerException will be thrown.
