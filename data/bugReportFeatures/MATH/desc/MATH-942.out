Creating an array with Array.newInstance(singletons.get(0).getClass(), sampleSize) in DiscreteDistribution.sample(int) is risky. An exception will be thrown if:

singleons.get(0) is of type T1, an sub-class of T, and
DiscreteDistribution.sample() returns an object which is of type T, but not of type T1.

To reproduce:

List<Pair<Object,Double>> list = new ArrayList<Pair<Object, Double>>();
list.add(new Pair<Object, Double>(new Object() {}, new Double(0)));
list.add(new Pair<Object, Double>(new Object() {}, new Double(1)));
new DiscreteDistribution<Object>(list).sample(1);


Attaching a patch.
