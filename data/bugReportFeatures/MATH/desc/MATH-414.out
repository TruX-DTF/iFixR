I get a ConvergenceException in  NormalDistributionImpl.cumulativeProbability() for very large/small parameters including Infinity, -Infinity.
For instance in the following code:
	@Test
	public void testCumulative() {
		final NormalDistribution nd = new NormalDistributionImpl();
		for (int i = 0; i < 500; i++) {
			final double val = Math.exp;
			try 
{
				System.out.println("val = " + val + " cumulative = " + nd.cumulativeProbability(val));
			}
 catch (MathException e) 
{
				e.printStackTrace();
				fail();
			}
		}
	}
In version 2.0, I get no exception. 
My suggestion is to change in the implementation of cumulativeProbability(double) to catch all ConvergenceException (and return for very large and very small values), not just MaxIterationsExceededException.
